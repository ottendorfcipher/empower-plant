# Architecture Overview

## User Management System

Outline of the architecture of the User Management event-driven microservice.

### Components

#### 1. **Server (Backend)**
- **Language/Framework**: Rust
- **Modules**:
  - **Producers**: Publish user events (e.g., `user_created`, `user_updated`) to specific Kafka topics.
  - **Consumers**: Subscribe to and process events from Kafka topics.
  - **Config**: Contains configurations for Kafka, MySQL, and other system components.

#### 2. **Client (Frontend)**
- **Language/Framework**: Swift (UIKit/SwiftUI for iOS)

#### 3. **Apache Kafka**
- **Components**:
  - **Zookeeper**: Manages Kafka broker states and configurations.
  - **Brokers**: Handles storage and transmission of messages.

#### 4. **Database**
- **Technology**: MySQL

### Data Flow

1. **User Operation Initiation**: User operations are initiated from client application.
2. **Server Processing**: The server processes these requests. With a successful user operation, the server publishes an event to a Kafka topic (e.g., `user_created`).
3. **Event Handling**: Services or components within the system may subscribe to these Kafka topics to consume/react to events, such as sending a welcome email upon `user_created`.
4. **Database Updates**: The server updates the MySQL database based on user operations. Changes in the database may also trigger events to be published.

### Scalability & Reliability

- **Kafka**: Kafka allows for decoupling of components and supports horizontal scaling through the addition of more brokers.
- **Rust**: Rust handles concurrent operations and data processing tasks.
- **Stateless Design**: The backend is designed to be stateless for easy scaling by adding more instances behind a load balancer.

### Security Considerations

- **Authentication & Authorization**: Secure access to user data is ensured through OAuth for authentication and role-based access control (RBAC) for authorization.
- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data is encrypted both in transit (using TLS) and at rest in the MySQL database.
- **Input Validation**: Protects against SQL injection and other forms of malicious input.

### Deployment

- **Containerization (Docker)**: Provides consistent deployment environments and simplifies dependency management.
- **Orchestration (Kubernetes)**: Manages deployed services for scaling and health monitoring.
